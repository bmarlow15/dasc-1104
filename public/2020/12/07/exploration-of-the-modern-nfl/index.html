<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The NFL Elo dataset contains 269 observations of 30 variables. The data was collected by downloading nfl_elo_latest.csv from the FiveThirtyEight Github page. Altogether, the data comprised in this file details the game-by-game Elo ratings and forecasts for the latest NFL season up until Dec 1, 2020. There are many factors that go into these predictive metrics, however the more important ones refer to the QB play on a given team. A few questions that I’m going to answer with the data are as follows: is there a significant gap in a team’s win probability once the QB rating is mixed in? Which teams have the biggest differential in this split? Additionally, has there been a steady increase of points scored throughout the regular season? If so, what might be the reasoning behind that? All these questions should help us to understand the true value of the QB in today’s NFL as well as where the game is headed as far as scoring is concerned.</p>
